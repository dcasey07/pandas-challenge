# Pandas Challenge: Module 4

## Objective

This code computes, sorts, and analyzes the school district's latest math and reading standardized tests and juxtaposes them with each school's current budgets in order to identify trends and develop a future strategy for the district. This analysis looks at the overall passing rates of the individual schools in the district and observes the various factors that potentially play a role in each school's performance. My analysis and conclusions can be found at the head of the PyCitySchool_starter.ipynb file.
